**To-Do List Project Overview**

As a part of our learning and comprehension of Javascript objects, we were tasked with building a small to-do list web application using OOP.  The criteria is as follows;


1. Must make use of _Object Oriented Programming_ in the information used on the flashcards. 

2. CSS must demonstrate a _minimal level of competency_, it cannot be left as black and white. 

3. Plus - while the added functionality of the user typing into the flashcards the information is nice but not a must. 
Javascript constructor functions must be utilized in this project even if itâ€™s minimal.

4. No Jquery allowed.
